Manages each jail's jailfs process.

[jailfs]
Each container will run an instance of jailfs.


jailfs is extensively multithreaded:
	* The main thread handles housekeeping
	* Database
		- sqlite based database for packages
	* pkg (Package Handling)
	* shell - User interface/admin console
	* vfs (Virtual File System)

----

Extensive use of LSD (libsd) for data types support.
	- ini-like configuration file with extensible syntax
	- Hooks system

Extensive modularity
	- Loadable modules
	- Message-based API for interthread communication


- We scan packages available (eventually only jailconf pkgs).
- When files are accessed (or when scanned if precache enabled)
  - Check the cache if it exists
    - If so, increase refcnt and return the file via FUE read-only (??)
  - Extract the file from the package into cache
    - Increase refcnt and return the file via FUSE read-only (??) from cache
  ? Support spillover files for changed files (someday)
