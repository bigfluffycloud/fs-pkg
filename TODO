Fix inotify to remove packages & files if deleted

* (jm) Feature/6 - Add support for cpio and squashfs image based packages.
* (jm) Feature/3 - Allow persistence of the database (right now we clobber
                   and rescan the pkgdir on startup.
* (jm) BUG/10    - Ensure even on unclean exit, we umount before dying...
* (jm) Feature/6 - unwind/profiling support from appworx/apxd
* (jm) Feature/4 - Code cleanup

Work on a library (LD_PRELOAD) method.
	* Needs read-only package database and a daemon to fill it
	* Needs way to disable inotify, etc
	* Needs way to disable fuse build
	* Add a pass-through mode
		- Try pkgdb
			[noent] try spillover
				[noent] try real fs
	* Add in-place decompression (at least libz)
		- To file
		- To buffer

Merge the hooks and loadable module support from appworx here

* De-duplicate some of the lists & trees code.
* Make sure EVERYTHING is using BlockHeap allocator
  - Can we replace malloc()/free() with wrappers which log?
