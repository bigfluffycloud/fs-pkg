* Inter-thread IPC mechanism
* Move as much as possible to thread/module private
* Make all the BlockHeap's totally thread-private
* Fix inotify to remove packages & files if deleted
* (jm) Feature/3 - Allow persistence of the database (right now we clobber
                   and rescan the pkgdir on startup.
* (jm) Feature/6 - unwind/profiling support from appworx/apxd

* De-duplicate some of the lists & trees code.
* Make sure EVERYTHING is using BlockHeap allocator
  - Can we replace malloc()/free() with wrappers which log?

When a package is added
-----------------------
* Scan archive, adding list of it's files/permissions/etc to the database

When a file is requested
------------------------
* look up what archive owns it.
	Resolver order:
		Overlays (fs-etc templates) as readonly
		$jail/pkg/*.spill (read-only from jail)
		$jail/pkg/*.pkg
		$top/pkg/*.pkg

* check the cache to see if it's cached in memory or on disk
	- Yes? Provide COW mapped file to FUSE
	- No? Extract the file to cache and provide COW mapped file to FUSE
