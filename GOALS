* Clean up the db_* code. We will only ever use sqlite3

* Reduce duplication of list/trees code
	- src/dlink.c
	- src/list.c
	- src/tree.c

* Ensure we use BlockHeap allocator anywhere possible

* Thread-safety and more threading

* Improve signal handler (signals.c) so that ALWAYS unmount

* Finish the shell

* Loadable modules (eventually)

* Finish the profiling code

* Cleanup and unify string handling code

* Redesign the VFS stuff to be less braindead
  - dict based path cache
     - templates (/config)
     - Spillover files (mmap)
     - Package files (mmap)
     - Passthrough (local fs)
