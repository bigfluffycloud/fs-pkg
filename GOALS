* Redesign the VFS stuff to be less braindead
  - dict based path cache
     - templates (/config)
     - Spillover files (mmap)
     - Package files (mmap)
     - Passthrough (local fs)

* Improve signal handler (signals.c) so that ALWAYS unmount

* Ensure we use BlockHeap allocator anywhere possible

* Thread-safety and more threading

* Finish the shell

* Finish the profiling code

* Cleanup and unify string handling code

* Merge unix.c support.c and host.c

* Loadable modules (eventually)


* Standardize API and document stuff better (lol)

* Make a script to repackage distro packages to .tar

* Maybe a bit of buffering on logs so that very early
  - startup messages can still be printed to the log
  - and not just stdout/stderr which may not exist





---------

startup
scan pkgdir & add all packages and files to db
