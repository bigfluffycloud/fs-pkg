When a package is added
-----------------------
* Scan archive, adding list of it's files/permissions/etc to the database

When a file is requested
------------------------
* look up what archive owns it.
	Resolver order:
		Overlays (fs-etc templates) as readonly
		$jail/pkg/*.spill (read-only from jail)
		$jail/pkg/*.pkg
		$top/pkg/*.pkg

* check the cache to see if it's cached in memory or on disk
	- Yes? Provide COW mapped file to FUSE
	- No? Extract the file to cache and provide COW mapped file to FUSE
