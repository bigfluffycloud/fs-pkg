How this beast works
--------------------

Top-level GNUmakefile contains rule 'symtab' which generates dbg/jailfs.symtab

We use this to look up where in the source code a symbol is defined

Examples:
	vfs_watch_heap B /opt/jailfs/src/vfs.c:33
	vfs_watch_init T /opt/jailfs/src/vfs_inotify.c:143

In the shell, you can use various commands to explore:

	Try help:

jailfs> help debug
