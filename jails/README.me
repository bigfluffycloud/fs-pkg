Here you will create one folder per jail.


The layout is so:


jails/jailname/:	
	config/				Settings, etc which are overlayed into jail
	pkg/				Local (non-pool) packages
	root/				Root mountpoint (MUST BE EMPTY!)
	spillover/			Spillover files (changes to packages)
	jailfs.cf			Configuration for the jailfs service

pkg/:			Global package pool
